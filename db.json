I‚Äôve visited so many beautiful spots and places I want to share with you. Today‚Äôs blog post is going to be my personal travel guide for Moscow with insights on where to stay, where to eat and what to see.\n\nEntry requirements for Russia\nTo enter Moscow, you will definitely need a visa. Make sure you apply for one well in advance. During periods of high demand, it will take up to 2 weeks until you receive it. You can apply for your visa via agencies like http://visa-plus.de.\n\nLocal transport\nPublic transport is rather cheap in Moscow. The most popular method of travel is the metro. It allows you to get to pretty much anywhere in the city, especially during peak travel periods. Although it is the fastest way to get around, it is definitely not the easiest, when you don‚Äôt speak Russian. I found it almost impossible to travel by metro, because there was no information in Englisch. I prefer to take an Uber or a Wheely. It is super easy and you can already book certain rides in advance ( very convenient for airport rides).",
